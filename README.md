## üêç Python Concepts Covered

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and Objects**: Basic class definition and object instantiation
- **Inheritance**: Parent-child class relationships and method inheritance
- **Method Overriding**: Customizing inherited methods in child classes
- **The `self` Parameter**: Understanding instance reference in class methods
- **Constructors**: Using `__init__` method for object initialization
- **Super() Function**: Calling parent class methods from child classes

### Data Analysis Libraries

#### NumPy
- Array creation and manipulation
- Array shapes and reshaping operations
- Array initialization methods:
  - `np.zeros()` - Create arrays filled with zeros
  - `np.full()` - Create arrays filled with specific values
  - `np.arange()` - Create arrays with sequential values
  - `np.random.randint()` - Create arrays with random integers
- Array stacking operations:
  - `np.vstack()` - Vertical stacking
  - `np.hstack()` - Horizontal stacking
  - `np.column_stack()` - Column-wise stacking

#### Pandas
- DataFrame creation and manipulation
- Reading CSV files with `pd.read_csv()`
- DataFrame inspection with `.head()`
- Data structure understanding and basic operations

## üåê Web Development Project

### Waste Management System
A comprehensive FastAPI-based web application featuring:

#### Features
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Role-based Access**: Citizens, Field Staff, and Admin roles
- **Issue Reporting**: Citizens can report waste management issues
- **Task Assignment**: Staff can be assigned to resolve issues
- **IoT Integration**: Smart waste bin monitoring
- **Reward System**: Points-based incentive system for citizens
- **Real-time Notifications**: Email notification system

#### Technologies Used
- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for building APIs
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM for data management
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for data storage
- **JWT**: Secure authentication tokens
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the application

#### Database Models
- **Users**: Authentication and role management
- **Issues**: Waste management problem tracking
- **Reward Points**: Incentive system tracking
- **Waste Bins**: IoT-enabled bin monitoring

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy pandas fastapi sqlalchemy uvicorn python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt]
```

### Running the Waste Management System
```bash
python waste_management_syssssstem.py
```
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### API Documentation
- Swagger UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

## üìö Learning Objectives

This repository demonstrates proficiency in:
- Python fundamentals and OOP concepts
- Data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas
- Web API development with FastAPI
- Database design and management
- Authentication and authorization
- Real-world application development

## üîß Common Issues and Solutions

### Python Class Issues
- **Indentation Errors**: Ensure methods are properly indented within classes
- **Method Definition**: Methods should be defined at class level, not nested within other methods
- **Self Parameter**: Always include `self` as the first parameter in instance methods

### Data Analysis Issues
- **Print Output**: Remember to use `print()` function to display results
- **DataFrame Creation**: Use correct syntax `pd.DataFrame()` (capital 'F')
- **Array Operations**: Assign results to variables or print them to see output

## üìà Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add data visualization with Matplotlib/Plotly
- [ ] Implement machine learning models for waste prediction
- [ ] Add frontend interface using React or Streamlit
- [ ] Integrate with real IoT sensors
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Deploy to cloud platform (AWS/Azure/GCP)
